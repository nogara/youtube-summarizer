    # Title: The Future of the World Depends on Quality Education

    ## Introduction
    The future of the world depends on providing quality education to every child, regardless of their background, and the importance of addressing mental health issues, even among successful individuals.

    ## Main points
    üéô FWE is continuing the legacy of its founder, Mr. Paul Kelly, by working with business leaders, education researchers, and policymakers to connect countries and promote international citizenship through education.

    üåç Disadvantaged population students need to contribute to their own country, FWE is planning to promote mass education internationally, and they are working with scholars to develop webinars and research programs. FWE is focused on promoting mass education and building an international network to support vocational education.

    üåç Switzerland is promoting vocational education to support young students and has a partnership with the US to learn from Swiss companies' successful workforce development.
    üë• We need to change and learn from other countries in order to improve education, and the speaker is grateful for the support.

    üåç Chen Davis and Dr. Susan Scani have been instrumental in gathering scholars and young leaders from around the world to improve the quality of education.

    üåç Every child deserves access to quality education regardless of location, ethnicity, or income for a better future.

    üéØ We work hard to champion the continued focus on the quality of education in schools to improve it for every child.

    üåç We work with educators and the business community to ensure opportunities for all children and look forward to learning and improving together.

    ## Conclusion

    The future of the world depends on providing quality education to every child, regardless of their background, and the importance of addressing mental health issues, even among successful individuals.

    The OUTPUT should be in the form of a markdown file. The bullet points should have two new lines between them.
